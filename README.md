# LanguageModels
This repository contains a walkthrough fundamental Language Models. The jupyter file present inside each folder contains the code and appropriate explanation to the development of the model and the framework used for development.

## 1. MakeMore
This model develops the understanding of sequence based probabilistic learning by walking through the implementation of a bigram language model developed using a probability graph and optimized further using a Multi-Layer perceptron. 

A list of names is used as the input to the model, the model is first trained only on the previous character pattern recognition and further optimized to develop contextual understanding using Multi-Layer Perceptron.
